        <h2>Brand Story of Pizza Max</h2>
        <p>
            Pizza Max is a new player in the restaurant industry.
            The restaurant is in a comfortable, familiar, big city that has a 
            strong need for additional dining options.  Bolstered by the need for
            more choices in family-oriented dining experiences, combined with the
            option for home-delivery, the restaurant is positioned to take 
            advantage of the market need and serve the families in the Karachi city.
        </p>
        <p>
            Karachi's population is rapidly growing with new subdivisions 
            and young families moving to the urban city.  
            It is Pizza Max's strategy to exploit the first-mover
            opportunity and establish itself as the preferred pizza provider to
            the area.  We believe a locally-owned restaurant is the best option
            to serve the rapidly growing population with a fresh, unique menu as 
            opposed to a national chain franchise.
        </p>

        <h2>History of Pizza</h2>
        <p>
            Founded around 600 B.C. as a Greek settlement, Naples in the 1700s 
            and early 1800s was a thriving waterfront city. Technically an independent
            kingdom, it was notorious for its throngs of working poor, or lazzaroni.
            <blockquote cite="https://www.history.com/news/a-slice-of-history-pizza-through-the-ages#:~:text=Pizza%20has%20a%20long%20history,to%20the%20city%20of%20Naples.">
            <q>The closer you got to the bay, the more dense their 
            population, and much of their living was done outdoors, sometimes in homes
            that were little more than a room,</q></blockquote> says Carol Helstosky, 
            author of <cite> Pizza: A Global History </cite>and associate professor of 
            history at the University of Denver.
        </p>
        <p>
            These Neapolitans required inexpensive food that could be consumed quickly. 
            Pizza—flatbreads with various toppings, eaten for any meal and sold by street
            vendors or informal restaurants—met this need. <q>Judgmental Italian authors
            often called their eating habits 'disgusting,'</q> Helstosky notes. These 
            early pizzas consumed by Naples' poor featured the tasty garnishes beloved 
            today, such as tomatoes, cheese, oil, anchovies and garlic.
